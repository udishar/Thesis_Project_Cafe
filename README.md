 ♦ My Website Name is FLAVOR HOUSE

 ♦ Why i choose to make this website? -> As i really want that in future i should have my own cafe so that idea inspired me to make this website then i discussed this idea of mine with my mentor he also guided me with the additionals.And then by trusting the process i ended up making my own very first website.

It was really a very exciting and great feeling when i deployed my website and saw it on my mobile phone , that feeling when everything is looking very fine according to the viewport was amazing.

I got to learn about lot of new things while making this project. I will definately work more on this to enhance it more.
